## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
**Favorite 5 applications**
- Youtube
    - i love the shorts function that there are so many videos on a cue just lined up ready to go
    - I love that you can watch most videos outside of the app 
- Maps
    - I like that i can save my favorite locations 
    - I love that i dont have to type too many characters or numbers and it is already populating different addresses
- Doordash
    - I like that it can give me orders knowing that i am the nearest dasher around to pick it up
    - I like the way that it creates a heat map of which restaurant or area has the most orders
- Messages
    -  I like that i can pin my most important conversations
    - I like that my messages never disappear
- Google
    - search functionality
    - I like the hum feature that can basically guess the song you are humming
**App I'd like to build** 
- I'd like to build a Igbo language app that can help individuals that originate from that heritage learn their language. I would like for the app to have different forms of spaced repetition techniques built in and active recall functions. Also i would like to gamifiy the app.
